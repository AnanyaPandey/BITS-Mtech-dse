## Data Structures : 

* DSAD is a 5 credit course. 1 Credit is 32 hours of effort. 
* Up till M4 is the Mid semester. 
* Complexity Classes should be the last topic 

### Evaluation Component
* Assignment 1 - 10 (group)
* Assignment 2 - 10 (group)
* Quiz         - 10
* Mid Term (open) - 30
* End Term     - 40

Algorithms are not about programming and its not about programming test. We can definitely apply everything in python.

###  Ground Rules 
=============

* Be Regular Follow Recordings 
* Mentally present - Observe + Listen 
* Keep Your Questions for QnA 
* Solve questions Regularly
* Go that Extra Mile. 

#### Why DSAD ?

* Aspiring Data Science / Engineering or Analytical field 
* Creating solutions and those have code and codes are of data structures.
* Think better solutions if you know DS. 
* DS -> Builds problem solving mindset. 
* DS Major learning curve in the field of comp science or Data Science.


### Wht is a program !
set of instructions to accomplish a task 

Algo + Datastructure = Program 
finite sequence of unambiguous instructions followed to accoplish a given task.

Input -> Algo => Output 
Many paths to reach same spot. 


### Properties : 
* 0 or more inputs
* Should give atleast 1 output
* instructions clear ambiguous
* effective = should transform input -> output
* Algo must terminate in finite number of sequence of instructions 

### Phases of program development 
(program not software/application)

A particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be ued effectively.

### Comparing algorithms is inevitable
Two parameter used : 
* Resource used  - Running Space
* Resource Used  - Running Time 

### how to measure running time ??
* write program out of that algo
* check the running time  But there is a problem !!!
* coding time and testing time is also different 
* every possible data testing is also impossible 
* Hardware and Sotware of two algo / two persons are different. 

Therefore we need to use analytical model to analuse the algorithms.
* algo is converted to pseudo code. (not programming language)
* try all possible inputs
* alllow evaluate of efficiency in a way independent of harware/software


### Running time also depend on :
* Single v/s multiple processor
* rd/wr to memory
* 32 64 bit architecture
* Input to algo.

### RAM MODEL : Randome access Machine Model- Imaginary machine 
* Assumes 1 processor
* Instructions are executed one after other no concurrency


model of computation is abstraction that allow to compare

### ASsumption of RAM
* each simple task is 1 time step (like 1 ms)
* loops and subroutine are simple operation
* 

Time complexity (running time ) = number of instructions executed 
Space complexity = num of memory cells accessed

### Pseudo code 
* High level description of algorithm
* More structured than natural language (english )
* Less detailed than a program
* Hides program design issues

Algorithm <> Pseudo Code <> Program

### Pseudo Code Guidelines :
* Less formal then prog language
* Control Flow 
* indentation braces
* Expressions <-  = and compare == 


### Primitieve Operation 
* evaluating expression
* assigning 
* Indexing into array
* Calling method
* Return from method (function)


Each line
Couont primitive operation in each line 
e.g. inside loop 

sorting itself is not primitive but
things iwthin sorring is primitive operations 

### Running time 
* Best Case
* Worst Case
* Average Case
* An algo may run faster on some dataset than on others.
* Average case is difficult to determine why?
* So we focus on worst case     
    * easier to analyse and best to bet
    * Crucial for applications, games robotics
    * performing well in worse case would definitely perform better in best case.
